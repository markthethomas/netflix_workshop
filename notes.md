Iterator
`var iterator = [1,2,3].iterator()`
The iterator will provide you with a value and boolean off of the iterator method
`{value: 1, done: false}`

Obvserver Pattern

    document.addEventListener("mousemove", function next(evt){
      console.log(evt)
    })

Iterator vs observer
- design flaw: the iterator/observer patterns were viewed as asymmetrical
- iterator/observer viewed as different today
